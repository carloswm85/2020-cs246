# 03 Ponder : Weekly Reflection

1. Describe one challenge your team experienced working on the JSON parsing activity.
We were not in the same page. Some of us were ahead of the others.


2. For the Prove API assignment, what did you learn about how APIs work?
I learned that I can use GSON with them.


3. Did you complete the Stretch Challenge for the Prove API Assignment? If so, briefly describe which method you used.
I didn't.


4. What did you learn from comparing your code to the teacher's solution?
Not much.


5. After completing the assignments this week, what questions do you still have?
None.


6. Aside from the task you completed, what is another use you could see for the API we used?
To connect my computer/software to an external API, like the ones offered by financial brokers.


7. A common Java interview question is "Describe what an API is and how it's used". (Sometimes people refer to these types of APIs as "REST APIs") How would you answer that question?
They're used to connect the client side to information inside the server, hidding anything about what's behind the API and inside the backend. The client can or cannot change the information that comes from the server side.


8. Of all of the resources in this week's reading, which was the _most_ helpful to you and why?
Probably it was the readings. There were some really good charts on some of the links, I even made some copies from them. And, also the videos about GSON from FutureStudio were really useful.


9. Of all of the resources in this week's reading, which was the _least_ helpful to you and why?
The teacher's solution to the prove of this week. There's a lot of errors in the code, which I will have to fix if I want to know how that code works.
