// An enum (short for enumeration) allows us to restrict a value
// to a specific list of strongly-typed options.
//
// Note that while enums are found in most languages, you can do 
// much more with them in Java than you can in other languages. 
// For more details, see: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html
